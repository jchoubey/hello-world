# hello-world
This is my first repository; a takeaway from the GitHub tutorial.

Hi there!

I am Juhi and I have just begun my journey on GitHub. The tutorial has been systematic and easy to understand till now. I hope to stay as active as possible on this account and contribute as much as possible to the community at large.

Happy Scripting!
Juhi
